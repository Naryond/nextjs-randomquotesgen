Next JS Project that calls a random quotes generator API Rest to output some data.

The logic is quite simple, the UI starts with an empty card. The moment the button is pressed the user(s) can read the quote of the day.

The phrase is rendered inside the box, at the footer the author is revealed.

For the design I used Bootstrap and React Bootstrap, the informations are retrieved using an Async/Await fetch call to an external API.
